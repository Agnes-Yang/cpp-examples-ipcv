Demo source code is provided "as is" to aid your learning and understanding of topics on the course.

Most run with a webcam connected or from a command line supplied video file of a format OpenCV supports on your system (otherwise edit the script to provide your own image source).

N.B. you may need to change the line near the top that specifies the camera device to use on some examples below - change "0" if you have one webcam, I have it set to "1" to skip my built-in laptop webcam and use the connected USB camera.
